## FAQ

**How do NAD+ supplements like NMN differ from direct NAD+ supplementation?**

Direct NAD+ supplements face severe bioavailability challenges since NAD+ molecules are too large to efficiently cross cell membranes, resulting in poor absorption and minimal systemic effects. NAD+ precursors like NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) are smaller molecules that cells readily absorb, then convert internally to NAD+ through natural enzymatic pathways. This precursor approach achieves dramatically higher intracellular NAD+ increases—Tru Niagen's 300mg NR boosts levels over 50%, while 1,000mg formulations reach 150% increases. Choose NAD+ precursors over direct NAD+ for proven efficacy validated through clinical research.

**What dosages of longevity supplements show research-backed benefits?**

Clinical studies demonstrate NAD+ boosting effects starting at 300mg daily nicotinamide riboside, with higher doses up to 1,000mg producing proportionally greater increases. NMN research typically examines 250-500mg daily doses, with some protocols testing 1,000mg. Resveratrol studies show benefits at 150-500mg daily, though absorption challenges require BioPerine or similar enhancers. Dosages below research thresholds—common in underdosed supplements padding profit margins—may provide minimal benefits. Verify supplement labels match clinical trial dosages rather than symbolic amounts insufficient for physiological effects.

**Are longevity supplements safe for long-term daily use?**

FDA-registered facilities manufacturing supplements like partiQlar, Tru Niagen, Thorne, and Life Extension follow GMP standards and use GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) ingredients extensively studied for safety. NAD+ precursors show excellent safety profiles across clinical trials spanning months without significant adverse effects. Third-party testing confirms absence of contaminants, heavy metals, and adulterants that could cause harm with chronic exposure. However, consult healthcare providers before starting supplements if taking medications or managing health conditions, since interactions may occur despite general safety.
